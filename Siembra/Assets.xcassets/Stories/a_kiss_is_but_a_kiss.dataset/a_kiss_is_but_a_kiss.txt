\'93I guess I would say, seeing the Pacific Ocean.\'94 Paul said picking up the paper menu on the table. He raised his head and glanced across the diner at the attractive redhead staring out the window, \'93Yes, definitely. The Pacific.\'94 He returned his attention to the menu, folding its edges, flipping it over and folding it in half.\
\
The man across the table from him regarded Paul and his dexterity. He curled his lower lip and nodded. \'93Interesting. Why Pacific?\'94\
\
\'93First time we saw it, it was a summer day. We had just driven across the country from Boston to LA.\'94 He folded the paper into a triangle, \'93We were tired, almost broke, and really scared. Then we topped this hill and there it was. God it looked so beautiful. Glistening, vast \'96 a metaphor for all our hopes and dreams.\'94\
\
\'93That\'92s very poetic Paul, worthy of Kerouac.\'94 The man said. Then leaning forward, \'93Most people say their first kiss, or when their children were born.\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t have kids\'94 Paul said without looking up.\
\
\'93Never will.\'94 The man added.\
\
Paul paused mid-fold and looked up at the man. \'93Made you look.\'94 The man added playfully.\
\
Paul did look, he looked at this smug man (if he can be so called) sitting across from him, wearing a grey pin stripe suit that fit seamlessly, creaseless on his broad frame. A beige shirt stuck out right under his neck and a pink pocket square brought it all together. Paul felt like he was sitting across from Al Capone, \'93would have had a better chance of living if I had,\'94 he quietly mused.  \'93Do you always make light of these situations?\'94 Paul asked the man with no name.\
\
The man grinned, revealing his row of crest-white teeth. \'93No,\'94 he said \'93You interest me.\'94\
\
Paul let out a small scoff, \'93Me? Give me a break.\'94 He returned to his paper which had been folded to half its size.\
\
\'93No, I\'92m serious.\'94 The man removed a cigarette and lit it up \'93Most men don\'92t go so easy. They kick up a fuss, scream, shout, bargain \'96 you name it.\'94 He took a deep puff and let it out \'93Some even trade to save themselves.\'94 Then looking at Paul, \'93But not you, no, very few people trade the way you do.\'94\
\
Paul looked over at the redhead by the window again. She was staring outside at the fire and white smoke that was being dowsed by the jets of water. She looked over at Paul and he immediately averted his gaze.\
\
\'93Don\'92t worry,\'94 the man said \'93she can\'92t see us, look all you want.\'94\
\
Paul readily returned his gaze to the woman. She was stunning - green eyes, small button nose, sun freckled cheeks, lips gently parted in the middle. \'93How could I not trade?\'94 He said without taking his eyes off her.\
\
The man turned in the direction of Paul\'92s gaze and looked at the woman. \'93She is a stunner.\'94 The man agreed. \'93But is she worth it Paul? It\'92s not every day you get the gift of life.\'94\
\
\'93She\'92s worth it.\'94 Paul answered and went back to the paper, making a final few folds to bring it to its final form.\
\
The man watched him with amusement, then turned back at the red head. \'93Paul, what if I told you that I made Renee over there the same offer I made you.\'94 Paul stopped and looked up. \'93And what if I told you, she refused, didn\'92t think you were worth it. What then?\'94\
\
Paul studied the man with no name, noticed for the first time that despite his expensive suit, chiseled features and cleft chin \'96 he was terribly ugly. \'93It doesn\'92t matter. I\'92ll stick with my original offer.\'94\
\
The man laughed, then prodded on \'93And what if I told you she cheated on you when you were on assignment in Nairobi? Cheated with that Stuart guy. What then Paul? Would you still make the trade? Give that undeserving harlot a second chance? Because I\'92ll tell you, she doesn\'92t deserve it. She\'92s better of burning---\'93\
\
The man could not complete his sentence because in the next instant Paul was on top of him, his one hand on the man\'92s collar and the other punching the burning cigarette from his mouth. \'93Liar. You fuckin\'92 liar.\'94 Paul screamed. \'93I\'92ll be damned before I hear another word from your mouth.\'94\
\
\'93Excellent choice of words Paul.\'94 The man replied and began cackling wildly. In that instant, poised over him, ready to deliver a second punch, and watching the man cackle wildly, Paul saw the true face of the man with no name, the face of the entity in guise of a man, the face of what lay in store for him. It froze him, fist still cocked in the air, the monumental dread settling on him. Paul let go of the man\'92s collar and retreated. His back found the diner wall and he sunk against it, tears choking out of him.\
\
The man got up straightened his suit, checked his teeth in the window of the diner. Outside, the smoke had cleared and EMT\'92s were approaching the car wreck. The man turned back to Paul, \'93No one\'92s punched me like that since Sinatra. Bravo Paul, those kiddie Muy Thai lessons have definitely paid off.\'94 He approached the distraught Paul slumped against the wall and looked him over, \'93There\'92s the reaction I usually get.\'94\
\
Paul looked up at the man and slowly brought himself under control, \'93I won\'92t give you the pleasure.\'94 He said wiping away the tears. \'93Take me, I\'92m ready.\'94\
\
The man smiled and offered Paul a hand, he got a glare in response. The man insisted \'93Relax Paul, she was never unfaithful.\'94\
\
\
A spark of relief popped into Paul\'92s eye then quickly retreated, \'93How can I trust you?\'94\
\
The man smiled, \'93I just wanted to see if you would still go through with it.\'94\
\
\'93Isn\'92t it your job to fuck with me? Eternal torment and all that?\'94\
\
The man laughed and leaned in, \'93I\'92m not the devil Paul,\'94 he smiled and offered the hand again, \'93Come. Let\'92s go.\'94  Paul took a moment, then nodded, took it and got up. He walked over and picked up his origami swan off the floor. As they were at the door of the diner, Paul turned around and looked at Renee still standing at the window of the diner.\
\
\'93She\'92s still there.\'94 He told the man.\
\
\'93Not for long.\'94 The man responded without turning around.\
\
They made their way outside. The EMTs had pulled the bodies from the wreck and placed Paul on a stretcher, Renee lay on an identical one beside him. The medics were working hard on both of them compressing their chests, a defibrillator was being used on Renee. Paul and the man stood off to the side, watching.\
\
Paul held up his origami swan to the man, \'93May I\'94 he asked.\
\
\'93It\'92ll haunt her.\'94 The man warned.\
\
Paul nodded and walked over to the wreck, he drifted into dispersing smoke, through a dying fire, past scrambling medics and firemen and reached Renee\'92s body. He tucked the swan into her coat pocket, stood back and looked over her. Then turned and returned to the man. As he did, a jolt of the defibrillator brought Renee back to life with a gasp. The medics immediately strapped on the oxygen mask. Renee looked around in confusion until her eyes fell on the lifeless body of Paul beside her. The medics loaded her up into the ambulance, her hand still stretched out towards her dead husband.\
\
Paul and the man watched as the ambulance door shut, then turned. They began walking down the street, fading gradually.\
\
\'93First time I\'92ve heard some say looking at an ocean is their favorite memory.\'94 Confessed the man with no name.\
\
\'93It was with her, that\'92s the difference. Every memory is about who you share it with. A kiss is but a kiss.\'94 Paul replied\
\
\'93Paolo Nutini?\'94 the man asked and Paul nodded. He laughed and before they completely vanished, added \'93It\'92s going to be fun getting to know you Paul.\'94\
