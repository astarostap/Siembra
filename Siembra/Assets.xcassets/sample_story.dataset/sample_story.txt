With this in mind, people who depended on the success of their Web sites increasingly
began modifying their Web-page authoring styles to score highly in search engine rankings.
For people who had conceived of Web search as a kind of classical information retrieval
application, this was something novel. Back in the 1970s and 1980s, when people designed
information retrieval tools for scientific papers or newspaper articles, authors were not overtly
writing their papers or abstracts with these search tools in mind.4 From the relatively early
days of the Web, however, people have written Web pages with search engines quite explicitly
in mind. At first, this was often done using over-the-top tricks that aroused the ire of the
search industry; as the digital librarian Cliff Lynch noted at the time, “Web search is a new
kind of information retrieval application in that the documents are actively behaving badly.”
Over time though, the use of focused techniques to improve a page’s performance in
search engine rankings became regularized and accepted, and guidelines for designing these
techniques emerged; a fairly large industry known as search engine optimization (SEO) came
into being, consisting of search experts who advise companies on how to create pages and
sites that rank highly. And so to return to the game-theoretic view: the growth of SEO
followed naturally once search became such a widespread application on the Web; it simply
mattered too much to too many people that they be easily findable through search.
